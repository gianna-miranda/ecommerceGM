      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>One Team One Soul</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Our mission is to get ride of the immigration detention centers we have today and make new detention centers. The immigration topic is sort of an awkward one because many people dont know what to say or how to aproach the topic. We understand that 100%. No one wants to say anything to offend others, but that does not mean we say nothing. We get it not everyone that migrates to the United States can stay, but that does not mean we can put them in cages with no basic necesities. We are an organization that helps the hispanic comunity thrive.</p>

      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We Are All Human</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Most of the people that migrate to the States do it in search for a better life. Many on the immagrants that come go through HELL and back to get here, and for what? To get lied to, seperated from their families, locked up in detention centers that are pretty much cages? It is not fair. You wouldnt like to be treated like something less than human. Just because they werent born in America they dont get the same rights as someone who was? They dont get the same rights as an American immagrant? Because if we are being truthful, unless you are a native american, you are also an immagrant. It is understandable to not pay much attention to what is going on if it doesnt affect you personally. We offer so many differnt producta because we want to reach as many different types of audience. </p>
